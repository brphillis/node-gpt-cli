# Node Express Chat GPT API Server by Brock Phillis

This repository contains a Node.js Express server that provides an API endpoint to interact with the Chat GPT model from OpenAI. Users can send messages to the server through the command-line interface (CLI) and receive responses generated by the Chat GPT model.

## Prerequisites

Before running the server, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Node.js: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if it's not already installed.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the Chat GPT API server, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/brphillis/node-express-chat-gpt-api.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project's root directory:

   ```bash
   cd node-express-chat-gpt-api
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

   ```plaintext
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   PORT=port-number
   ```

   Replace `your-openai-api-key` with your OpenAI API key, and `port-number` with the desired port number for the server.

5. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. The server should now be running and listening for API requests.

## Sending Requests through the CLI

To interact with the Chat GPT API server using the command-line interface (CLI), you can use the `gpt` command. The command accepts the following options:

- `-m` or `--message`: The message to send to the Chat GPT model. This option is required.
- `-f` or `--file`: The path to an optional file to append to the message.

Here's an example of how to use the `gpt` command:

```bash
gpt -m "How can I improve this file?" -f "path/to/optional/file.txt"
```

Replace `"How can I improve this file?"` with your desired message, and `"path/to/optional/file.txt"` with the path to an optional file to append to the message.

The server will process the message and return the generated response from the Chat GPT model.

## API Endpoint

The server exposes a single API endpoint that can be accessed using HTTP requests:

- **POST /chat**: Sends a message to the Chat GPT model and returns the generated response. The request should include a JSON payload with the following structure:

  ```json
  {
    "message": "The message to send to the Chat GPT model"
  }
  ```

  The response will have the following structure:

  ```json
  {
    "response": "The generated response from the Chat GPT model"
  }
  ```

  The endpoint can be accessed using tools like `curl` or by sending HTTP requests programmatically.
